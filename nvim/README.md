# Devstack44 Neovim Configuration

This is my neovim configuration for 2025. This is a work in progress and will be further modified.
Things that I plan to modify:

1. keymaps
2. plugins

The current keymaps that I have in my configuration come from someone else's configuraions and I will change some of these keymaps to my own prefernces.

There are a couple of plugins that I want to use in my configuration but I need to research a bit more before I install them.

Plugins currently added to this configurationn are:

1. autocompletion
2. autoformatting
3. bufferline
4. colortheme (Tokyo-night)
5. gitsigns
6. indent-blankline
7. lsp
8. lualine
9. neotree
10. telescope
11. treesitter
12. misc:
    a. vim-tmux-navigator
    b. vim-sleuth
    c. vim-fugitive
    d. vim-rhubarb
    e. which-key
    f. autopairs
    g. todo-comments
    h. nvim-colorizer
    i. goyo
    j. vim-pencil

Items that I still plan to add to my configuration:
